# JavaScript Name Converter

- This is my Second Javascript mini-Project. In this project I have made a Name converter with JavasCript, which converts your text to Camel Case, Pascal Case, Snake Case, Screaming Snake Case, Kebab Case and Screaming Kebab Case

- It took me 3-4 hrs to make this project.
